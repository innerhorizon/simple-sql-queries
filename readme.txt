Simple SQL Tables...

== Description ==

Simple SQL Tables...

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings->WP Post Stickies screen to generate a shortcode

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't my Post Stickies working after the last update? =

Originally the plugin didn't use custom post types; after version 1.60.0 they were implemented. With this release, the ability to display notes with the old shortcodes have been removed. You'll need to update any existing Post Stickies to use the new format. We apologize for any inconvenience, but this is way better... trust us.

= Why don't you have more/different colors? =

We went with standard "sticky note" pastels.  We are planning to add some other types of posts to the plugin which will offer additional color and style options.

= Why is there blank space at the bottom of my note? =

Sticky notes (the real ones) tend to be either square or rectangular, so we set up our plugin with a minimum height.  If you just use a few words of text, you'll have some white-space at the bottom.  If you use a ton of words, however, the note will scale.
